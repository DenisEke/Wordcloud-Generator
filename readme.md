## WordCloud Generator with NestJS & React

Welcome to the WordCloud Generator repository! Initially built as my first real SaaS learning endeavor, this tool aimed to facilitate effortless word cloud generation. This journey allowed me to explore Stripe Payment Integration, Firebase Auth, Firebase Storage, and Firestore. While I hoped to monetize it, I've come to realize the significance of MVP (Minimum Viable Product) in product development. I'm showcasing the source code as a testament to this learning adventure.

# Overview

This application, rooted in Python, crafts word clouds. With a NestJS backend for functionality and a React frontend for user interaction, it offers a comprehensive experience.

# Repository Structure

backend/ - The NestJS backend framework.
frontend/ - React frontend components and UI.
gen/ - Python scripts for word cloud generation.

# Why Was This Made?

Born out of personal necessity, this tool captures the essence of visualizing vast textual data via word clouds. I envisioned a unique solution that catered not just to my needs but could benefit many others. However, this journey was much more than tool creation. It underscored the nuances of product development, user engagement, and MVP's pivotal role.
